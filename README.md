# branchOut

### Group Project

## Overview

If you are an instructor who struggles with an endless amount of paper documents to keep track of for all the impressive lessons you write, might we suggest you go out on a limb and trust branchOut with all your lesson planning needs! It's as simple as visiting the branchOut website to view courses and the lessons which go along with them, or if you're ready to write a whole new course, just click on the 'Add New Course' tab. This will allow you to enter your amazing content and write as many lessons as you need to go along with it. If you need some time to create new lesson ideas it is very easy to come back and add lessons to an existing course. Your genius plans will be safely stored in the branchOut database.
